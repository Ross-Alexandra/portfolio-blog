# Welcome to the hidden markdown test file. This is a test of the markdown compilation system.
It was written in markdown

And now:
 - it is being rendered to HTML
 - and will be displayed on *this* blog

```python
print("Isn't that cool?")
```

And even **further**, we can have a [link](https://www.google.com) to somewhere else.

But what about an image?
[![A cool image](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)](https://www.google.com)
BAM! Done.

Oh, you thought I was done? Nope. I can also have a table:
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  |
| Value 3  | Value 4  |

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! I can also have a blockquote:
> This is a blockquote
> It's pretty cool, right?

You want headers? I got headers:
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

And the cherry on top? Custom HTML:
<x-counter></x-counter>

That's right, I can have custom HTML. And you can't stop me. 

~~And that's it. That's the end of the file~~
Just kidding, I just wanted to show you that I can have strikethrough text. 

ok, now I'm done.
